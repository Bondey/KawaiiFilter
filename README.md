## Features

### Hidding process images by DKOM
**Some stuff need to be done before using this feature**

  1- **Disable PatchGuard, try [EfiGuard](https://github.com/Mattiwatti/EfiGuard), [UPGDSED](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UPGDSED) or [Shark](https://github.com/9176324/Shark).**

  2. **Enable testSigning: "bcdedit /set testsigning on"**

### Sysmon Like system monitoring
- Can monitor de wole system (not recomended)
- Can filter by PID, a new PID is monitored if:

  -- Is created by a monitored process

  -- Gets a new Remote Thread from a monitored process
  
  -- A Handle to the process is opened by a monitored Process

### ATM this Driver monitors
- Registry
- File System
- Image Load
- Thread creation
- New Proceses
- Open Process
